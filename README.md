Image instance segmentation carries out the task of segmenting instance targets at the pixel level and is a significant development direction in the field of artificial intelligence and computer vision. The technology is widely used in many industries, including industrial production, surveillance and security, and healthcare. The evolution of the fishery industry urgently needs artificial intelligence’s involvement to increase productivity and alter working methods, but all this is premised on the computer being able to identify and segment fish from their surroundings. As a result, in this project, several instance segmentation algorithms were chosen for evaluation on the fish dataset, and the performance of each algorithm was evaluated on the full dataset and half dataset, respectively. Additionally, several different GPUs were used for training in order to determine whether the GPU model would have an effect on the experiment’s outcomes. Finally, the algorithm with the best overall performance is chosen for optimization in order to further improve the algorithm’s performance for the fish dataset. The overall performance of the SOLO algorithm in this dataset is good, according to the evaluation’s final findings. Performance improvement after optimization is also evident, and the segmentation image also performs well.
